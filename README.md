# README

## Overview
This repository includes: (1) an essay explaining why data science is strategically important, (2) a simple analysis of a public credit card fraud dataset in R and Python, and (3) a concise summary of the Machine Learning Engineer role and requirements.

## Essay insight
- Core idea: Data science functions like “the new electricity,” enabling smarter decisions, automation, and innovation across domains such as healthcare, finance, and marketing.
- Context: It builds on decades of statistics and computing, scaled with the internet/big data era, and accelerated with deep learning and accessible cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
- Takeaway: Organizations that embrace data science gain a lasting advantage; those that don’t risk falling behind.

## Dataset analysis
- Data: Public credit card transactions dataset hosted by TensorFlow, with PCA features V1–V28, plus Time, Amount, and Class (0 = non‑fraud, 1 = fraud).
- R script (credit-card.r): 
  - Downloads the CSV, computes mean/median/variance of Amount, and plots the Class distribution using ggplot2.
- Python notebook (Credit_Card.ipynb):
  - Loads the same CSV via pandas, previews the first rows/columns, and serves as a base for extending EDA or adding simple models.

Dataset URL used in both R and Python:
https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/creditcard.csv

Files:
- credit-card.r
- Credit_Card.ipynb

## Chosen role: Machine Learning Engineer
- Focus: Design and build ML systems, turn prototypes into production solutions, run tests/experiments, fine‑tune, and retrain for continuous improvement.
- Skills and tools: Strong statistics and programming (Python/R), data science foundations, software engineering (version control, modular design, APIs), and ML/MLOps stacks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit‑learn, MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes; AWS/Azure/GCP).
- Key requirements: Construct sophisticated models, refine existing systems, apply rigorous analysis, and create efficient self‑learning applications that adapt over time.

## How to run

### R script
1) Ensure R is installed.  
2) Run the script (it installs ggplot2 if needed), which will download the dataset, print summary stats, and display a class count bar chart.

### Python notebook
1) Open in Jupyter or Google Colab (Python 3).  
2) Run the cells to load the dataset from the URL and preview the data.
